# Leads-Classification-Problem

Objective was to create a Classification Model that will help to Identify the Potential Leads from generated set of Leads. This will help Sales Team focus on communicating with Potential leads, rather than just dialing all the leads. 

The Code file contains EDA and ML done on the data with insights.

I've used Random Forest, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression to perform this classification.
